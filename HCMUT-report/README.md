# Thesis Proposal (Update)

This is the README template for my Thesis Proposal report written in LaTex.

## Project setup

- This project uses LuaLatex and BibTex for native Vietnamese support and bibliography management. 

## Conventions

- All `Tex` files should starts with the 2 magic comments

    ```tex
    %! Compiler = lualatex --shell-escape
    %! BibTeX Compiler = biber
    ```

- Figures paths should not contain file extensions (`.png`, `.jpeq`...)  

[TBA]
